# Roadmap: from demo to a complete Might & Magic 3-5 style engine

Goal: a content creator writes `.map` + `.evt` files, data tables and assets, and ships a full game
with a story, quests and an ending. Content tooling stays at the level of the originals (tile events
with opcodes, fixed monster placement, data tables); the engine side (graphics, movement, UI) may be better.

## Decisions (2026-10-06)

1. **Combat is turn-based, always.** Roguelike rounds: the party takes a turn (step, strafe, attack by walking into a monster, use, cast, wait), then every monster acts. Turning in place is free. There is no real-time mode.
2. **Dungeons and towns first.** Overworld, terrain and sky only if good assets turn up.
3. **Our own classes and races**, not the MM3 list. Data tables, curated later.
4. **Our own spell list**, curated.
5. **Default party plus character creation at the inn.** Hirelings are a later nice-to-have.
6. **Desktop and web** are both targets. Saves: file on desktop, browser storage on web.
7. **Monster animation depends on the sprites found.** Frames are used when a sheet has them.
8. **Chiptune synth stays** until better sound sources are found.
9. **The editor must be able to build a complete campaign** (maps, events, world file, data tables).

## What exists today

- Grid renderer: five generated wall materials, floor, ceiling, billboards (objects, monsters, decorations), world signs, torch light, dither, minimap.
- Movement: step, strafe, turn, tween, mouse/touch, held-key walking.
- Event VM: the Xeen opcode set (`op-codes.md`), labels, prompts, self-modifying events (in memory only).
- Party: characters with stats, resistances, awards/skills/conditions/spells flags, slots, shared stacked inventory, weapon catalog with five material tiers, four spells, six shops, NPC dialogs, cutscenes, help screen, HUD portraits, hit markers.
- Monsters: billboards with a random walk and fixed HP, killed by the debug bolt. No combat.
- Audio: synthesized effects and loops. Editor: paint walls, edit tile scripts. Desktop and web builds.

## A. Must have for a shippable game

### A1. Save / load (nothing exists)

- [x] Serialize party (characters, inventory, equipped, gold/gems/food/bank, flags, time).
- [x] Serialize world: position, facing, current map, VM patches, per-map cell changes, moved objects, taken floor items, monster state.
- [~] One slot (F5 / F9); file on desktop, browser storage on web. Slots and autosave pending.
- [ ] Load on title screen / menu; quick save & load keys.

### A2. Combat (nothing exists beyond the bolt)

- [~] Monster data table (`maps/monsters.txt`): id, sprite, HP, AC, damage, exp. Pending: speed, attack kinds, resistances, special attacks, loot class, ranged/caster, boss flag.
- [~] Monster AI: chase within sight, attack when adjacent, wander otherwise. Pending: pathfinding, ranged, flee.
- [~] Turn-based play everywhere (decision 1): step / bump-attack / wait = one turn, then monsters act. Casting costs a turn. Pending: block, speed.
- [~] d20 to-hit vs AC with level and accuracy, weapon damage plus might. Pending: criticals, ranged row.
- [ ] Conditions: poisoned, diseased, asleep, paralyzed, unconscious, dead, stone, eradicated, cursed, weak, drunk; effects on turns and stats; cure sources (spells, temple, time).
- [~] Experience, gold drop and message strip done. Pending: item loot, scrolling log.
- [ ] Respawn rule: non-boss monsters return after N days.
- [x] Party wipe → message, then the title menu.

### A3. Characters

- [~] Class and race tables (`maps/classes.txt`, `maps/races.txt`): HP/SP per level, level cost, stat modifiers. Pending: allowed classes, spell schools.
- [x] Level-up at the trainer from the class table.
- [ ] Skills table and effects (direction sense, cartographer, spot secret doors, danger sense, swimmer, mountaineer, pathfinder, linguist, merchant, thievery, …).
- [ ] Stats actually used in rules (might → damage, speed → initiative, endurance → HP, luck → saves, personality/intellect → SP).
- [ ] Character sheet screen (stats, resistances, skills, awards, conditions) replacing the debug `P` panel.
- [~] Inn (`town inn`): create a character by prompts, leave members at the inn, take them along, up to 6. Pending: portrait choice, re-rolls.
- [ ] Aging, and `age` effects if wanted.

### A4. Spells

- [ ] Full spell table (`spells.txt`): school, level, SP and gem cost, target (self / one / party / one monster / all monsters), power by level, duration.
- [ ] Target picker for single-target spells.
- [ ] Timed buffs (bless, heroism, protection from X, power shield, holy bonus, …) and the `*tmp` stats they set.
- [ ] Utility spells with world effects: light (done), wizard eye, levitate, water walk, jump, teleport, town portal, Lloyd's beacon, time distortion, etherealize, super shelter, day of protection, day of sorcery, awaken, cure *.
- [ ] Guild membership per town; spells bought by level.
- [ ] Spellbook with the right lists per class.

### A5. Items

- [~] Armor: leather, chainmail, plate, cloak, helmet, boots, shields by material. Pending: material tiers for body armor, gauntlets.
- [ ] Enchantment model: material prefix + base + attribute suffix (`of Might`, `of Fire`, elemental damage, stat bonuses) with effects applied when worn.
- [ ] Item generation by level for loot and chests; treasure tables per monster loot class.
- [ ] Cursed, unidentified and broken items; identify and repair at the smith.
- [ ] Usable items in the world (wands with charges, scrolls that cast, quest items).
- [ ] Carry limit (weight or slots) and gems as a currency in shops.

### A6. World and time

- [~] Game clock: one minute per turn, day rollover. Pending: rest, shop time, day/night.
- [~] Rest (R): full heal for one food each, refused near monsters. Pending: random encounters.
- [~] Doors: `D` is an open doorway drawn as a door, `L` a locked one that scripts open with `altercell X Y D`. Pending: bash, traps, secret doors.
- [ ] Wall decorations: torches, grates, signs, stairs, cave mouths, town entrances.
- [ ] Terrain types with rules: water (swimmer / water walk), swamp (poison), lava (damage), desert, snow, road, mountains (mountaineer), forest; movement cost or block.
- [ ] Outdoor maps: sky backdrop, horizon, day/night tint, distant trees/mountains as blocks or billboards.
- [ ] Full map screen with explored cells (cartographer skill), map name, coordinates.
- [~] World file (`maps/world.txt`): title, start. Pending: map names, music, indoor/outdoor.

### A7. Story, quests, win state

- [x] Journal (J) listing awards with text from `maps/awards.txt`.
- [~] Opcodes `win` and `gameover` (last word, then title); awards text table. Pending: score, credits.
- [~] Title menu: new game, load, quit. Pending: options, credits, art.
- [ ] Intro / ending cutscenes with full-screen art (text-only pages exist).
- [x] Party wipe → message, then the title menu.

### A8. Shops, completed

- [ ] Temple: cure each condition, uncurse items, donate for a blessing.
- [ ] Smith: repair, identify.
- [ ] Bank: gems, interest per day.
- [~] Tavern rumors from `maps/rumors.txt`. Pending: per-town files, prices.
- [ ] Guild: membership + level-gated spells.

### A9. Audio

- [ ] Load real tracks and effects (OGG) by name; keep the synth as fallback.
- [ ] Per-map music from the world file; combat and boss music; victory, game over, title.
- [ ] Monster attack / hit / die sounds from the monster table.
- [ ] Volume options.

## B. Should have (the "better than the originals" part)

- [ ] Gamepad support.
- [ ] Message log (scrollable history of event and combat text).
- [ ] Options screen: volume, key bindings, movement speed, dither, fullscreen (partly in the Esc menu).
- [x] Animated monsters from sprite sheets (idle / attack / hurt / death); see op-codes.md.
- [ ] Wall texture sets per map (cave, castle, crypt, sewer, …) loaded from PNG, replacing generated stone.
- [ ] Smooth day/night lighting outdoors; weather is optional.
- [ ] Quest markers on the map screen for known quest tiles (optional, not in the originals).
- [ ] Portrait expressions by condition (poisoned, asleep, dead) or at least condition icons on the HUD.

## C. Content tooling

- [~] Editor: monster palette from the asset folder, door cells in the wall palette. Pending: objects, items, decorations.
- [ ] Editor: world file editing (map list, start, music), NPC registry, cutscene preview.
- [ ] Data tables as text files in `maps/` or `data/`: monsters, items, armor, spells, classes, races, skills, awards, rumors. Today spells, the item catalog, rumors and the trainer formula are Go code.
- [ ] Opcode lab kept in sync with new opcodes (`win`, doors, terrain).
- [ ] A `blobber check` command that lints a campaign: missing sprites, unknown items/monsters/spells, bad jumps, unreachable maps.

## D. Known loose ends in the current code

- Properties `levitate light wizardeye walkonwater` are documented but not stored by the party.
- Bolt spells fly in real time after the turn passes, so a monster may step out of the way.
- Spells and the item catalog are compiled in (rumors, awards, classes, races, monsters are data files).
- NPC portraits are recoloured party portraits (see `maps/npcs.txt`).

## E. What you need to provide

All sizes are suggestions matching the current code (128 px textures, 45 px portraits, 16 px icons).
Everything is PNG with transparency unless noted; audio is OGG.
